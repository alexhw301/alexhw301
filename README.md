- 👋 Hi, I’m @alexhw301 !!
- 👀 I’m interested in figuring out some personal/passion projects I can do in my free time, I don't want to just do work in class anymore! Really enjoy the idea of a project that can clearly help other vulnerable people (healthcare tech? I'm not sure), but also I love and want to pursue game programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mostly how github works, and how I can be a part of it. Next, I want to get deeper into C++, and possibly start on Python. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... [TBD]
- 📫 How to reach me: my email robert.fernandez301@gmail.com, or my linkedin @ https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafr3/
